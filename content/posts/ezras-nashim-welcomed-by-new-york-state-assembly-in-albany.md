(Albany N.Y.) A delegation from Ezras Nashim (EN), a New York State (NYS) Basic Life Support – First Response service, were recently present in the Assembly Chamber of the New York State Capitol Building in Albany. The organization, based in Boro Park, Brooklyn, NY, led by the Hon. Rachel E. Freier, EN Executive Director and a NYS Certified Paramedic, were the invited guests of Assemblywoman Nily Rozic (D-Queens). Assemblywoman Rozic gave them a “Floor Introduction” and praised the membership of Ezras Nashim in front of the entire New York State Assembly and Chamber guests. The EN membership is made up of Orthodox Jewish women volunteers, who are NYS Certified Emergency Medical Technicians.

Assemblywoman Rozic gave a rousing speech recognizing the Ezras Nashim members for their volunteer efforts of taking the initiative and training and then putting it into actions that preserve a pious woman’s modesty, while providing them appropriate, quality pre-hospital care, during medical emergencies. She said that Ezras Nashim’s service is invaluable and they should be recognized for their impact. She concluded by saying, “It’s my honor today to ask if we can extend the cordialities of the floor to welcome Ezras Nashim EMT’s and advocates to the people’s house.”

The Speaker Pro Tempore of the Assembly, Hon. Jeffrion L. Aurby, concluded with the following warm message, “On behalf of Ms. Rozic, the Speaker, and all the members, we welcome you here to the New York State Assembly and extend to you the privileges of the floor. Thank you for the work that you are doing to ensure the health and well-being of the women who come to you for aid. Please continue that work. Know that we will always be grateful for the service that you’re providing. Thank you.” The introduction was followed with thunderous applause by everyone in attendance in the State Assembly Chamber.

The visit to the State Capitol was arranged by Assemblywoman Rozic. The Assemblywoman, herself, is Jewish and was born in Jerusalem, Israel. Assemblywoman Rozic felt that more members of the Assembly and State government should know of Ezras Nashim’s good work. By meeting some of their EMT members, the name of the organization would be more meaningful. This introduction enabled the Assembly members to feel the passion of these Ezras Nashim emergency medical professionals. Ezras Nashim wants to care for their female neighbors and allow them to maintain the same modesty and dignity that they would want themselves. This was Assemblywoman Rozic’s way of honoring this volunteer Emergency Medical service.

After their “Floor Introduction” the Ezras Nashim delegation had the honor of meeting NYS Lieutenant Governor Kathy C. Hochul. Lt. Gov. Hochul addresses the attendees of the annual NYS Emergency Medical Services Memorial Service, each May, during National EMS Week and has expressed her deep respect for the work they do.

This special day in New York State Capitol will long be remembered by those Ezras Nashim members that were in attendance. There is no greater reward for a volunteer than to hear the words, “Thank you”. It has special meaning, when it comes from the elected members in the “People’s Chamber”, the home of the New York State Assembly. Perhaps, an exception to this would be the reward of knowing that their volunteer EMS training brought extra comfort to a patient and saved their life.
