  A colorful, life-saving event happened once again this year, on 13th Avenue
  between 48 Street & 49th Street in Boro Park, Brooklyn. On June 23, 2019,
  hundreds of participants gathered from 1:30pm – 4:30pm under colorful balloons
  and the watchful eyes of professionals ready to teach them life-saving
  information.

There’s more safety education involved with the yearly event, and it includes the free distribution of informative magnets and fliers regarding ticks/Lyme Disease safety, pool safety, and reminders about CPR techniques to be used on adults and children.

Here are the flyers that were handed out:
