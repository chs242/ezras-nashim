                <p class="text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base">Ezras Nashim is a NYS Certified Basic Life Support First Response organization (BLS-FR) endorsed by prominent Rabbonim.<br><br>
                                                           Ezras Nashim’s primary purpose is to train women as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) who can then assist women in emergency situations, and preserve her dignity. Ezras Nashim is also obligated by law to serve anyone who calls for their service regardless of gender and race.</p>

                <p class="text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base">Ezras Nashim strives to provide emergency care to women in the Orthodox Jewish community. Our goal is to expand our growing network of trained professional female EMTs that are available 24/7. It is our hope that Ezras Nashim will become an indispensable part of the Brooklyn community and then spread to Jewish communities around the globe. We will allow women to focus on their health, rather than the loss of their dignity, during an medical emergency.</p>

                <p class="text-xs md:text-sm lg:text-base">Over the last fifty years, volunteer-based Emergency Medical Services (EMS) groups have grown to become renowned international organizations servicing Jewish communities world-wide; the care they provide is invaluable and unparalleled. We are deeply grateful to the men who volunteer their time and rely on their services for ourselves, family and friends. However, there is a significant void in first response medical services in the observant Jewish Community that we are prepared to fill: Dignified emergency care for women, provided by women.<br><br>
                    As observant Jewish women, Tznius, or modesty, is way of life. It dictates the way we dress, speak and act on a daily basis. Our personal identity and the defining characteristic we bring forth to nations of the world is our dedication to Tznius. According to Jewish law, the preservation of human life trumps almost anything, even Tzinus.<br><br>
                    For the past five decades, Jewish women have been given only two sub-par options in emergency care: be treated by men in their immediate community, resulting in a very uncomfortable situation that threatens their Tznius or turn outside the community for assistance. Inspired by our ancestral midwives, Shifrah and Pooah, it is time for Bnos Yisroel to reclaim our role as healers and midwives for our mothers, daughters, sisters and fellow woman. B’Zchus Nashim Tzidkaniyos, we invite you to become our partners.</p>
